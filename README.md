## Installation
### For Rails
Copy the following to your project:

- `dist/img`
- `dist/css` (if you'd like to load the CSS)
- `dist/_scss` (if you'd like to `@import` the Sass)

When loading Sass, first update the Bourbon and Neat `@import` paths for the asset pipeline:
````scss
// Change...
@import "bourbon/app/assets/stylesheets/bourbon";
@import "neat/app/assets/stylesheets/neat";

// To...
@import "bourbon/bourbon";
@import "neat/neat";
````

Then load Jersey:
````scss
@import "jersey/dist/_scss/jersey";
````

### For non-Rails
Install Jersey using Bower by including it in your `bower.json` dependencies.
````javascript
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "jersey": "git@github.com:centresource/jersey.git#0.1.1",
  }
}
````

````bash
bower install
````

Include Jersey in your HTML `<head>`:
````html
<link href="stylehseet" src="path/to/jersey.css"/>
````

Or include Jersey in your Sass file:
````scss
@import "jersey/_scss/jersey";
````
